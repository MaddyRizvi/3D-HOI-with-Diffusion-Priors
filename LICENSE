      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    Ownership / Licensees
    The Software and the associated materials has been developed at the

    Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (hereinafter "MPI").

    Any copyright or patent right is owned by and proprietary material of the

    Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e.V. (hereinafter “MPG”; MPI and MPG hereinafter collectively “Max-Planck”)

    hereinafter the “Licensor”.

    License Grant
    Licensor grants you (Licensee) personally a single-user, non-exclusive, non-transferable, free of charge right:

    To install the Model & Software on computers owned, leased or otherwise controlled by you and/or your organization;
    To use the Model & Software for the sole purpose of performing non-commercial scientific research, non-commercial education, or non-commercial artistic projects;
    Any other use, in particular any use for commercial, pornographic, military, or surveillance, purposes is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, incorporation in a commercial product, use in a commercial service, or production of other artifacts for commercial purposes. The Data & Software may not be used to create fake, libelous, misleading, or defamatory content of any kind excluding analyses in peer-reviewed scientific research. The Data & Software may not be reproduced, modified and/or made available in any form to any third party without Max-Planck’s prior written permission.

    The Data & Software may not be used for pornographic purposes or to generate pornographic material whether commercial or not. This license also prohibits the use of the Software to train methods/algorithms/neural networks/etc. for commercial, pornographic, military, surveillance, or defamatory use of any kind. By downloading the Data & Software, you agree not to reverse engineer it.

    No Distribution
    The Model & Software and the license herein granted shall not be copied, shared, distributed, re-sold, offered for re-sale, transferred or sub-licensed in whole or in part except that you may make one copy for archive purposes only.

    Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties
    You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Model & Software results from basic research, is provided “AS IS”, may contain errors, and that any use of the Model & Software is at your sole risk. LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MODEL & SOFTWARE, NEITHER EXPRESS NOR IMPLIED, AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY LEGAL OR ACTUAL DEFECTS, WHETHER DISCOVERABLE OR NOT.

    Limitation of Liability
    Because this Model & Software License Agreement qualifies as a donation, according to Section 521 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB) Licensor as a donor is liable for intent and gross negligence only. If the Licensor fraudulently conceals a legal or material defect, they are obliged to compensate the Licensee for the resulting damage.
    Licensor shall be liable for loss of data only up to the amount of typical recovery costs which would have arisen had proper and regular data backup measures been taken. For the avoidance of doubt Licensor shall be liable in accordance with the German Product Liability Act in the event of product liability. The foregoing applies also to Licensor’s legal representatives or assistants in performance. Any further liability shall be excluded.
    Patent claims generated through the usage of the Model & Software cannot be directed towards the copyright holders.
    The Model & Software is provided in the state of development the licensor defines. If modified or extended by Licensee, the Licensor makes no claims about the fitness of the Model & Software and is not responsible for any problems such modifications cause.

    No Maintenance Services
    You understand and agree that Licensor is under no obligation to provide either maintenance services, update services, notices of latent defects, or corrections of defects with regard to the Model & Software. Licensor nevertheless reserves the right to update, modify, or discontinue the Model & Software at any time.

    Defects of the Model & Software must be notified in writing to the Licensor with a comprehensible description of the error symptoms.
